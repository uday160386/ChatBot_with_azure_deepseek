Check if there are any seasonal events or temporary exhibits. But since the user didn't specify when they're going, maybe keep it general. Avoid anything too niche unless it's a must-see. Ensure the information is up to date, like noting that Notre-Dame is still under renovation after the fire. That's important because they might not be able to go inside. Also, mention the Paris Museum Pass for savings on entries. Transportation tips, like using the Metro, could be helpful. Safety tips, like watching out for pickpockets in crowded areas.

            "- **Eiffel Tower**: Visit day *and* night (sparkles hourly after sunset). Book tickets early or reserve a Seine River cruise for stunning views. \n",
            "- **Notre-Dame Cathedral**: Still undergoing restoration (post-2019 fire), but the exterior and surrounding Île de la Cité are awe-inspiring.\n",
            "- **Arc de Triomphe**: Climb for panoramic views of the Champs-Élysées and the city’s radial street design.\n",

            "- **The Louvre**: Prioritize masterpieces like the *Mona Lisa* and *Winged Victory*. Buy tickets online to skip lines.\n",
            "- **Musée d’Orsay**: Impressionist fans shouldn’t miss Van Gogh, Monet, and Degas in a stunning former railway station.\n",
            "- **Centre Pompidou**: Modern art lovers will adore its avant-garde exhibits and rooftop views.\n",
            "\n",
            "### **Charming Neighborhoods**\n",
            "- **Le Marais**: Wander medieval streets, boutique shops, and the lively Place des Vosges. Don’t miss falafel on Rue des Rosiers!\n",
            "- **Saint-Germain-des-Prés**: Literary cafés (Café de Flore, Les Deux Magots) and chic Parisian vibes.\n",
            "- **Latin Quarter**: Lively student area with bookshops, the Sorbonne, and the Pantheon.\n",
            "\n",

            "- **Marché aux Puces de Saint-Ouen**: Massive flea market for antiques and vintage finds.\n",
            "- **Pastry Shops**: Try *macarons* at Ladurée, *croissants* at Du Pain et des Idées, or a *pain au chocolat* at a local boulangerie.\n",
            "- **Evening Dining**: Book a classic Parisian brasserie (try steak frites or onion soup at Le Comptoir du Commerce).\n",
            "\n",
            "### **Day Trips**\n",
